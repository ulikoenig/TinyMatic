# TinyMatic

TinyMatic was formerly named `HomeDroid` and was created back when Android 2.1 was the latest version of Android and before I started developing software professionally.

Even though the app has been updated to work with target SDK 29, most of the code is pretty old with a lot of technical debt.

The app is database driven and the DB is synced with the CCU periodically. The entry point from which the flow can be followed is `PeriodSyncManager`.
TinyMatic also supports push notifications by running a local XML-RPC server, entry point `RpcForegroundService`Â´.

On the UI Side, the main screen is `MainActivity`.
All screens that show data are built on top of `ServiceContentActivity` and `DataFragment`.
The UI is notified about new data using broadcast notifications, which trigger a refresh of the UI from the DB.

Any CCU data is parsed and translated into UI by `ListViewGenerator`, including widget content.
To add support for a new device type, most likely the only place that needs changes is this class.

## Please Note

*TinyMatic is 'All rights reserved', meaning that it is NOT licenced under an open-source licence (yet) and permission is explicitly NOT given to publish binaries based on any code in this repository.

(This sounds scary but I simply want to avoid that someone steals the app. I have no issue with someone forking the code for private use and I welcome any contribution!)
